    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>I am 22 year old computer scientist who is extremely passionate about web development and data visualisation. Currently residing in London, I graduated from the University of Southampton and currently work at FactSet. I consider myself best in Java but I have spent a great deal of time developing numerous web applications so I have a decent amount of experience in web-related technologies and languages such as JavaScript  </p>

    <h2>Fractal Viewer</h2>
    <p>Created a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java and the Swing and AWT libraries which displays a visual representation of a Mandelbrot set to the user. It also allows them to zoom into the set visualisation as well as viewing the visualisation of the Julia set for a specific point on the Mandlebrot set. The produced images can be saved along with options of different colouring schemes for the visualisation as well as numerous visualisation algorithms.</p>
    <h2>Crossword Puzzle</h2>
    <p>A crossword puzzle application made in Java using Swing and AWT libraries . It provides a clean and simple user interface and allows users to easily type across the boxes with their answers. Clues are provided and hovering the mouse over them highlights the corresponding boxes to be filled in. Functionality exist to inform the users of correctly filled answers as well as allowing users to save and load crossword puzzles.</p>
    <h2>The Clangers</h2>
    <p>Created a a small world filled with Clangers on the moon. Written in C++ with OpenGL 3.3+, this world allows the user to explore the world while also providing an automatic tour of the main features consisting of numerous clangers, mmon terrain, boats and other models. All the models present in the world were created in Blender.</p>
    <h2>Type Pong</h2>
    <p>A game aiming to improve typing speeds created as a group project. Users play pong while typing, moving the paddle as they type the words correctly. Users can play against the AI in levels, where AI gets better with time, or in challenge mode, where AI is perfect and users try to last as long as possible. Users can also play against each other as well as view their high scores. The backend of the application was built in Python while the game itself was built in JavaScript. 
	The application can currently be found here .</p>
    <h2>Privacy Matters</h2>
    <p>For my third year project, I created Privacy Matters, an online resource showing the information companies in the United Kingdom store and share. Users can search for their desired companies and view reasons for processing data, the data processed, whom it is processed from and whom it is shared with. Data visualisations such as an overview of the information collected as compared to the general median/average are also provided. Moreover, users can view similar companies to the ones they are looking at. The backend of this application was coded in Java with the Play Framework while the front end was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript . The database used was MongoDB. 
	The application can currently be found here . The final report on my project is also available here .</p>
    <h2>IdeaBoard</h2>
    <p>I teamed up with coursemate to create a note-taking web applicaiton for my Web Development module. We tried to abstract the idea board model, a board where people stick a number of post-it notes on to help visualise their thoughts. This application allows people to create boards and have notes in a column of their choosing. The notes themselves can be customised in relation to text formatting and colour. This application has a NodeJS backend with a MongoDB database while the front end is written in HTML,CSS and JavaScript 
	The application can currently be found here . The user manual for this application is available here and the technical manual is available here .</p>
    <h2>Mobile Intervention Authoring</h2>
    <p>For our group development project, my group and I worked on improving and extending a mobile intervention editor to create an intervention for cochlear implant users. This project involved adding features to add media files on the web-based intervention editor and functionality to play these media files on the intervention client application. Lastly, the intervention was created with numerous optimisations on the editor and run on the client application. The intervention editor was written mostly in CoffeeScript with BackboneJS and the client application was for Android devices. The report for this project can be found here.</p>
    <h2>NHS Waiting Times Application</h2>
    <p>A group project to create an applicaiton which, given a location, would find you the closest hospitals with the least amount of waiting times for Accident and Emergency (A &amp; E). This application uses open data from the NHS in the form of percentage of patients seen in the first four hours of coming to the hospital as well as hospital ratings. Moreover, it combines with OpenStreetMap to provide the location on the map. This application can be used on the web or on a mobile phone just as easily and was made with the help of basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A report for the project can be found here. </p>
