                        I am a computer scientist passionate about web development and data visualisation. I graduated from the University of Southampton and now work as a Software Engineer at FactSet in London. I am most experienced in Java and web-related technologies such as JavaScript and its numerous common frameworks and libraries. Outside of development, I enjoy reading books (favourite genre is fantasy and favourite author is Brandon Sanderson), playing video games (all time favourite games are Dota 2, the Mass Effect and Grand Theft Auto series) and watching football games (favourite team is Chelsea F.C.) as well as taking part in them myself.
